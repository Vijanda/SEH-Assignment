Project Summary:

Namibia university of Science and Technology (NUST) want to create awareness about the strategic direction
of the university. The university has a guiding document called strategic plan in which all goals and the key
performance indicators (KPI) are outlined. The university community and the public do not effectively read and
get to know the plan. In an effort to encourage the public to engage the plan more, the department of
institutional planning proposed the gamification of the plan. You are required to make a game that will assist
the stakeholders to learn more about the plan and get to memorize and understand the strategic direction of
the plan. You are free to propose your own ideas of the game.
